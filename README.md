This is 32nd screencast, called "32. React Todo App - Phase 4"<br />
https://scrimba.com/course/glearnreact


In the previous iteration of this todo list app, we pulled in todos data from a JSON file and mapped over it to display the todo items.<br /><br />

Eventually we'll want to be able to modify the data, which will only happen if we've "loaded" the data in to the component's state<br /><br />

Challenge: Change the App component into a stateful class component and load the imported `todosData` into state.
